- Other comments in the PR

#### Third PR: UI/UX Improvements: https://github.com/alvarosps/SILVA_fe_ALVARO_exercise/pull/3
- Card component when showing user data is displaying the user information in a clean and organized way, with the avatar on the side (although the images coming from the API are not working), the name as key information and display name and location on the bottom
- when hovering the cards, the background color changes, giving more emphasis to the hovered card
- Pagination was implemented for the List component, allowing the user to create pagination for the lists when wanted (it's optional), very useful for the Teams page.
- Created unit tests for the pagination
- The search component is in the header for the main page
- The team's name and search component, in the Team overview, are on a second header of the page
- Page's responsiveness were dealt with, making component responsive for all views
- General UI improvements, more details on the PR
